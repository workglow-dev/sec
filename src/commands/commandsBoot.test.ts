/**
 * Asserts the registered command TREE, against `program.commands`, rather than
 * against `--help` text.
 *
 * `cli.integration.test.ts` already boots the real binary in a subprocess, so a
 * module that fails to resolve anywhere in the command graph fails there
 * loudly — that is the check for "does the CLI start at all", and this file is
 * not a second copy of it.
 *
 * What a help-text check cannot do is prove a group was REGISTERED. It matches
 * a substring of prose, and ten of the sixteen group names appear more than
 * once in `sec --help`: `version` appears as the `-V, --version` global option
 * and inside two descriptions, `resolve` four times, `fetch` three. Unregister
 * the `version` group and `toContain("version")` still passes, because the
 * global option supplies the string. Matching `c.name()` exactly is the only
 * form no amount of description text can satisfy by accident.
 *
 * It costs one in-process import, and it needs no subprocess — so it also
 * covers the graph on a runner where spawning `bun` is unavailable.
