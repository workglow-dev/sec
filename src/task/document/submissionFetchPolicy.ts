 * answer this question and they did not all agree. The read path gated 8-Ks on
 * a known-SPAC-plus-trigger-item predicate while both bulk download paths
 * fetched every 8-K's `.txt` unconditionally — so what was on disk for a given
 * 8-K was a function of ingest history rather than of the form, and a consumer
 * could only find out by looking.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a helper inside `ProcessAccessionDocFormTask`
 * because `spacCandidateDownload` already imports the form sets from there; the
 * policy importing back would be a cycle. The sets live here now and that
 * module re-exports them, so nothing downstream had to move.

 * no financial elements at all, which is why 1-K produced 0 financial rows
 * across all 2,997 filings — and the annual report sits beside it as
 * `<TYPE>PART II`. Reading the full submission gets BOTH out of one request.
 *
 * The 1-SA is deliberately NOT here. Its primary document IS its report — every
 * one of the 2,792 filings records a `.htm` primary doc where every one of the
 * 3,001 1-K filings records a `.xml` — so escalating it would fetch the whole

 * Fetched whole for EVERY 8-K, with no gate. An 8-K's primary document is
 * routinely four sentences pointing at the EX-99.1 press release that carries
 * the news, so the exhibits are not an extra — for this form they are the
 * filing. Only the full submission carries them, and only it carries the
 * `<TYPE>` / `<DESCRIPTION>` / `<FILENAME>` manifest that says what each one is.
 *
 * The cost is bounded: it is one request either way. What it buys is that
 * "what is cached for this 8-K" stops depending on which path fetched it.
 *
 * Deciding to fetch the whole submission is NOT deciding to feed all of it to
 * an extractor. Those were one flag once, which is why widening the fetch used
 * to mean widening a model's input. They are separate now — see
 * `ProcessAccessionDocFormTask`, which asks each of the form's extractors its
 * own `readsFullSubmission`. The item-code reading declares none and never sees
 * the body; the known-SPAC trigger-item predicate survives unchanged as the
 * gate on what the readings of the filing's exhibits and narrative are handed.
