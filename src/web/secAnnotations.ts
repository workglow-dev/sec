 * Commander carries a flag's name and its help text and nothing else, so a
 * `<cik>` is a string, `--format` accepts anything, and `db reset` looks like
 * `db status`. These tables are where that is stated. Nothing here changes what
 * a command does — the CLI is unchanged and the terminal is unaffected.
 *
 * Vocabularies a value has to come FROM are named as a `format` and resolved by
 * the matching picker in `secFieldWidgets.ts`, which reads the live registries,
 * so a dropdown cannot offer a value the CLI would reject. Only closed
 * vocabularies with nowhere else to live are written out as `choices` here.
