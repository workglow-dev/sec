 * code is retryable under the extractor version that recorded it, red where it
 * is version-gated. It is deliberately NOT a verdict on whether a given row is
 * retryable right now — that also depends on whether the extractor version has
 * advanced past the row's `failed_extractor_version`, and this panel is built
 * from the command's `pending` output, which carries no current versions. A red
 * row whose version has since moved on IS eligible, and the note points at the
 * surface that can actually answer that rather than implying this one does.
 *
 * The amber set is bounded in a way the tone cannot show either:
 * `MIXED_CAPTION_SHAPE` is same-version retryable for a limited number of
 * attempts and then falls back to the version gate, which is why the `attempts`
 * column is rendered beside it.
