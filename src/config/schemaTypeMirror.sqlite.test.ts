/**
 * The prerequisite that makes `addMissingColumns` safe to run at all.
 *
 * That pass has to state a column TYPE, so it carries a JSON-Schema → DDL
 * mirror of the storage layer's own emitter. A wrong mirror is worse than the
 * bug it fixes: a missing column fails loudly on the next write, while a column
 * created at the wrong type is accepted and mismatches silently until some
 * value does not fit it. The emitter lives in the `workglow` dependency, so
 * nothing in this repo forces the mirror to stay honest — except this.
 *
 * So: create every registered table from its declared schema on a real SQLite
 * database, read back what the emitter actually wrote, and require the mirror
 * to have predicted it. A type the emitter changes, or a schema keyword the
 * mirror does not model, fails here rather than at 3am inside `db setup`.
 *
 * SQLite only. There is no in-process Postgres to create tables in, and the
 * Postgres half of the mirror is instead pinned statement-by-statement in
 * `addMissingColumns.test.ts` against the emitter source it mirrors.
 */

/**
 * Columns the mirror deliberately declines to type, which the add-column pass
 * therefore skips with a warning rather than guessing at.
 *
 * Kept explicit and kept SMALL: this is the list an operator would have to
 * handle by hand, so adding an unmappable type to a schema must be a decision
 * someone makes here, not a silent no-op discovered later. Format is
 * `table.column`.
