/**
 * The header row for one filing whose primary document has been converted to
 * markdown. The markdown itself is NOT here — it lives on the
 * `filing_section` rows this row counts.
 *
 * Splitting them that way is what keeps a reader who wants one section from
 * paying for the whole filing: an S-1 renders to the better part of a megabyte
 * of markdown, and "jump to Risk Factors" should be one short row, not that
 * megabyte followed by a scroll. Storing the document markdown here as well
 * would double the table for a copy nothing reads on its own.
 *
 * One row per DOCUMENT, not per filing. A submission is a directory: the
 * primary document plus the exhibits filed with it, and for an 8-K the
 * disclosure is routinely in the exhibit rather than the four sentences of
 * primary that point at it. {@link FilingDocumentSchema.doc_file} is part of
 * the key, and {@link FilingDocumentSchema.is_primary} marks the one a bare
 * `/filings/{cik}/{accession}` URL renders — the directory's index.
 *
 * Graphics, XBRL payloads and the fee exhibit are not rows here. They are
 * members of the submission but not prose, and a directory listing of things
 * that render to noise is worse than one that admits its scope.
