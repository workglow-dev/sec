# Changelog

## Unreleased — BREAKING: re-founded as the Workglow example project

`@workglow/sec`'s source now lives in `embarc-data`, which no longer depends on
this package. Everything that existed to serve it as a superset is gone, and
what remains is the worked example of the Workglow libraries.

**Upgrading is `sec db reset` and a re-run.** Forty-four tables are dropped;
there is no migration, and there is nothing to migrate to. Anyone with data
they care about is running `embarc-data`, which is unaffected.

### Removed

- **The library surface.** No `exports`, no barrel — both binaries bundle.
  `import ... from "@workglow/sec"` no longer resolves.
- **Nine downstream-contribution seams**, none of which had an implementer:
  `registerFilingConversionGate`, `registerDatabaseExtension` /
  `registerDatabaseSetupHook` / `registerDatabaseViews`,
  `registerCurrentTrustRefresh`, the editorial importers, `registerDbStatsTables`.
- **The identity tier** — observations, canonical resolution, the address, phone
  and company-name normalizers, roster completeness. Submission addresses and
  phone numbers are no longer stored.
- **Extractor versioning** — `component_versions`, `extractor_runs`,
  `version_events`, dead letters, backfill descriptors, and the `version` and
  `extractor` command groups.
- **Form extractors** — Form D, C, 1-A, 1-K, 1-Z, QUALIF, CFPORTAL and the
  ownership forms no longer parse into storage. The form classes remain as a
  dictionary of names and descriptions.
- **The eval harness** and the model-call trace reader.
- Query leaves for the tables that went: `offerings`, `crowdfunding`, `reg-a`,
  `persons`.
- The `better-sqlite3` devDependency and its `trustedDependencies` entry,
  unused since `@workglow/sqlite` moved to `node:sqlite`.

### Added

- **`sec ask`** — retrieval-grounded question answering over filing prose, with
  citations naming the filing and linking the document. Works with no API key:
  local ONNX embeddings, and a local generation model where no cloud key is set.
  `sec index` builds the index ahead of time.
- **`xbrl_fact` has a writer.** The documents sweep now reads each converted
  document's inline XBRL, so the table this package created and could query is
  finally one it can fill.
- **Form ADV** — `sec load download adv` and `sec update adv`, landing into
  `adv_adviser` and a generic `adv_row`, with `sec show advisers`.
- **`sec status`** — one screen showing what is loaded, how stale, and what to
  run next. Bare `sec` runs it.
- **`sec read`** — a filing as markdown, from the database or straight off a
  local HTML file. `--trace` replaces the `verify` group.
- **`engines: {"node": ">=24", "bun": ">=1.4.0"}`.** The floor `node:sqlite`
  needs was documented and not declared, so `npm i -g @workglow/sec` on Node 22
  installed cleanly and failed later, reading as a storage bug rather than a
  version error.
- **`release` derives the bump.** It cut a patch unconditionally, and on a 0.x
  line the minor is the break slot — so a heading like this one would have gone
  out as 0.1.6 and resolved for anyone on `^0.1.5`. It now runs `bunset --auto`
  behind a shared `release-checks` gate set, which reads the bump off the
  commits and off a diff of `package.json` against the last tag. The `engines`
  field above is exactly what that diff is for: a runtime floor that appeared is
  a break no commit message describes, and it raises this release to the minor
  on its own.

### Changed

- **The command tree is named for intent**: `setup`, `status`, `get`, `update`,
  `load`, `show`, `read`, `index`/`ask`, `fetch`, `db`. `init`, `sync`,
  `bootstrap` and `query` remain as aliases.
- **Every command suggests the next one**, suppressed by `--quiet` and emitted
  as data under `--json`.
- **`sec load download` states its size and time** and asks before spending it.
- **8-K is an ordinary convertible form.** The gate that converted none by
  default, and the `--all-8k` flag that escaped it, are both gone.
- **`db setup` / `db reset` / `db stats` loop the storage registry** instead of
  naming every token by hand. Adding a table is one entry and nothing else.
- **ONNX models default to CPU** (`SEC_ONNX_DEVICE=webgpu` to override), and an
  embedding repo id now resolves to the embedding pipeline rather than to text
  generation.
- Providers register only where their key is present; the pricing table and the
  per-extractor model override matrix are gone.
- `typecheck` covers src, scripts and tests in one pass; `typecheck-tests` and
  `tsconfig.test.json` are gone. CI runs it before the build.
- `sec fetch golden-fixtures` is now `bun run check-fixtures`.
- `isUniqueConstraintError` matches `node:sqlite`'s numeric `errcode` (2067
  UNIQUE, 1555 PRIMARY KEY). That driver reports every failure as
  `code: "ERR_SQLITE_ERROR"`, so the `"SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE"` string — a
  `better-sqlite3` spelling — never matched, leaving SQLite with the error
  message as its only signal.
